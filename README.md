# How to teach your computer to play guitar

You can find the talk [here](https://github.com/Arkham/webcamp-2019/blob/master/talk.md). I am using [DeckSet](https://www.deckset.com) to present.

I've built the demos using Ellie, so you can edit the source on the left
hand side, then press "Compile" to see the changes.

The first demo can be found [here](https://ellie-app.com/5wDzdJyjQ6Ca1). You can click on the notes to hear them played using the WebAudio API.

The second demo is [here](https://ellie-app.com/6HZqvnz8Py4a1). You can use arrows to
navigate between slides.

The Elm library which powers both demos is
[elm-chords](https://github.com/Arkham/elm-chords). Have fun!
